            <strong> Stick breaking neural latent variable models </strong></br>

            Neural processes define a class of neural latent variable models.
            We extend this class to an infinite dimensional space by imposing a
            stick-breaking prior on the latent space. Using Stochastic Gradient
            Variational Bayes, we perform posterior inference for the weights of
            the stick-breaking process and develop the stick-breaking neural process (SB-NP).
            SB-NPs are able to learn the dimensionality of the latent space and
            have improved posterior uncertainty.

            <strong> Characterizing and warping the function space of Bayesian neural networks </strong></br>
            In this work we develop a simple method to construct priors for Bayesian neural networks
            that incorporates meaningful prior information about functions.
            This method allows us to characterize the relationship between weight space and function space.

            <strong> Mapping Gaussian process priors to Bayesian Neural Networks </strong></br>
            What defines a reasonable prior to use when forming and training Bayesian models?
            It is difficult to incorporate meaningful prior information about functions to be
            modeled by BNNs since priors are generally specified over the network parameters.
            Often, normal distributions are placed over the weights for convenience and
            are interpreted as a bias toward less complex functions via smaller weights.
            Gaussian processes, on the other hand, have a elegant mechanism for incorporating
            prior beliefs about the underlying function - specifying the mean and covariance functions.
            However, Gaussian Processes have scalability limitations making Bayesian neural networks
            a more practical model in large data settings.
            In our work, we present an approach to specify a more principled prior for
            Bayesian Neural Networks that can leverage the well studied kernel design techniques
            from Gaussian process regression.

                        <strong> Generalized Feedback Alignment </strong></br>
                        The back-propagation algorithm is one of the main tools for credit assignment
                        in neural networks where the loss gradient is computed to back-propagate error
                        from the output layer to the hidden layers. A method called feedback alignment
                        performs almost as well and is more biologically plausible since it avoids using
                        the weights from the forward pass in the the backwards pass by replacing them
                        with random feedback weights. This method can be made even more biologically
                        plausible by decoupling the error signal for each layer, such that the error is
                        not back-propagated through the layers but rather proceeds directly to each hidden
                        layer. This is known as direct feedback alignment. In this work, a general
                        feedback alignment strategy for training neural networks is proposed and experi-
                        mented with in an supervised and unsupervised setting

                        I conducted research in Atmospheric Physics. Specifically, I used bayesian

                        stations such as temperature, wind speeds, surface pressure speciﬁc humidity
                        and solar intensity.
